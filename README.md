# Maternal Postnatal Mental Health: Impact on Infant Temperament

## Introduction

This project investigates the cascading effects of maternal postnatal mental health on infant temperament, examining how maternal well-being may shape early temperament traits. The study employs path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore direct and indirect pathways between maternal mental health indicators (such as anxiety and depression) and various aspects of infant temperament. By clarifying these relationships, this project seeks to inform early intervention strategies that support maternal and infant mental health during this critical developmental period.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the cascading effects of maternal postnatal mental health on infant temperament, identifying specific pathways and quantifying the relationships through SEM. This analysis aims to provide insights into early developmental influences and potential areas for targeted support.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- **`scr/`**: Python and Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and results preparation.
- **`models/`**: Output models resulting fro the scripts.
- **`publication preparation/`**: Visualizations, tables, and other outputs generated during the analysis.

## Scripts

1. **Data analysis.ipynb**: This notebook conducts a comprehensive analysis of maternal mental health factors and their impact on infant temperament. It includes steps for data exploration, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and structural equation modeling.
   
## Acknowledgements

This project is based on real-world, anonymized data on maternal mental health and infant temperament. We thank all study participants, research teams, and institutions involved, with special gratitude to collaborators for their input in study design and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maternal-mental-health-impact.git
   ```

2. **Set up your Python environment:** Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed. The required packages are listed in the `requirement.txt` file. Install them with:
